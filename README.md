# Pythonsedat

## 📌 Overview  
**Pythonsedat** is a collection of **automation and analysis scripts** developed for diverse applications, including **image processing, automation, and residency estimation**. These scripts streamline tasks such as detecting circles in medical images, automating reviewer invitations for academic journals, estimating U.S. residency status, and organizing thoughts through mind mapping.

## 🚀 Features  
- 🏥 **Image Processing** – Automatic circle detection for wound and stent analysis.  
- 📑 **Academic Automation** – Bulk reviewer invitation handling for journals.  
- 🧠 **Mind Mapping** – Structuring and visualizing thoughts in a network.  
- 🇺🇸 **Residency Estimation** – Calculating the transition from non-resident to resident status in the U.S.  
- 🎨 **Color Detection** – HSV-based wound detection for medical applications.  

## 🛠 Installation  
Clone the repository:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sedatkacar56/Pythonsedat.git
```
Navigate to the directory:  
```sh
cd Pythonsedat
```
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (if applicable):  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📂 Scripts & Descriptions  
| Script | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **`2-Circlefind.py`** | Detects circular objects automatically, useful for analyzing **wounds or stents**. |
| **`automaticreviewerinvitation.py`** | Automates the process of inviting **hundreds of reviewers** for Hindawi journals. |
| **`colourfuldetectionhsv.py`** | Uses **HSV-based color detection** for wound healing analysis. |
| **`w2colourfuldetectionhsv.py`** | Another implementation of HSV-based **wound detection** with variations. |
| **`mindmap2.py`** | Generates **mind maps** to structure and visualize ideas efficiently. |
| **`resident_alien_estimation.py`** | Estimates when a **non-resident will become a U.S. resident**, following IRS rules. |

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage  
Run any script using Python:  
```sh
python script_name.py
```
For example, to use **circle detection**:  
```sh
python 2-Circlefind.py
```
To estimate **U.S. residency status**:  
```sh
python resident_alien_estimation.py
```
